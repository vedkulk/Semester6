Agatha Christie, often called the "Queen of Crime," was one of the most famous and successful writers of detective fiction. Born on **September 15, 1890**, in **Torquay, England**, she grew up in a wealthy family and was largely homeschooled. From a young age, she displayed a keen interest in storytelling, but it wasn't until the First World War, when she worked as a nurse and later as a pharmacy assistant, that she developed her deep knowledge of poisons—something that would later become a trademark in many of her mystery novels.  

Her writing career took off in 1920 with the publication of *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, which introduced the world to the eccentric yet brilliant Belgian detective **Hercule Poirot**. Over the years, she created other iconic characters, such as **Miss Marple**, a shrewd elderly woman with a knack for solving crimes. Christie's novels, including classics like *Murder on the Orient Express* (1934) and *And Then There Were None* (1939), became bestsellers, cementing her status as one of the most widely read authors of all time.  

Despite her literary success, Christie's personal life had its challenges. In 1926, she mysteriously disappeared for eleven days following the breakdown of her first marriage, leading to widespread media speculation. She later remarried archaeologist Max Mallowan, accompanying him on excavations in the Middle East—experiences that influenced several of her works. Over her career, she wrote **66 detective novels**, **14 short story collections**, and **the world’s longest-running play, *The Mousetrap***. She was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1971 and continued writing until her death on **January 12, 1976**. Today, her stories continue to captivate readers and inspire countless adaptations in film, television, and theater.
